# CustomView
工作当中遇到很多使用频率很高的控件，为了方便，写了这个lib封装了一些常用自定义控件，
比如网络加载**WebView**的一些封装，地址联动选择器**AddressPicker**。

* [1.网络加载WebView](../doc/webview.md)

* [2.地址联动选择AddressPicker](../doc/addresspicker.md)

## Download

You can copy the ProgressWheel.java (in the library module) and the attrs.xml content into your project. Or you can get the binaries from Maven central by adding in your build.gradle dependencies:

```compile 'com.cvlib:cvlib:1.0.1'```

## Versions

* 1.0.0 Initial release

* 1.0.1 WebView的封装，自定义地址联动选择AddressPicker.
